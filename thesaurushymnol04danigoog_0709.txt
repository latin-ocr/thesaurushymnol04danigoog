Sequentia Thomae, notis musicis adornata, aevo nostro
primum innotuit Angliae cura ao merito. Ecclesiologist
XCVII Aug. 1853 p. 228 sq. ,This sequence is to be con-
sidered in the light os a litersry curiosity, rather than as
possessing any great merit. lt was known that Thomas oi'

Geleno, the author os the Dies Irae, hed composed two other ,

Sequences; Wadding, the great Frsnoiscan Annslist, writes
thus: *“ Sequentias tres scripsit, quarum prims. insipit,
Fregit victor virtualis. Secunde, sanctitatis nors
signa. Tertia, Dies irae, dies illast -· On this, Mr.
Trench observes, —- „One cen ieorn only with a deep regret
that two other hymns were composed by the same author, -
which have now perished, or, if they still exist„ lie hidders
somewhere, altogether ont os sight os mau.“ Yet, he oon·
xtinues, „our sense os their loss is in pert diminishedby the
. extreme probability which the first line of st least ne of the
hymns, in connection with the known circumstances of the
writer's lise, suggests, thet these two were not, like the
Dies Irae, poems oie world-wide interest, but rather the
glorisyings of his great patron and friend.“ — Mr. Treuch’s
guess, it will be seen, is correct. ln examiniug the Eccle-

rubrius, ete, written for some Franciscan Convcnt in thet
kingdom. At the end, occurs the „Prusa de Beeto Fren-
cisoo“‚ which we now, sor the first time, print. Thehrst
